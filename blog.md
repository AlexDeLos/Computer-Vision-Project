# Adding a trainable pre-processing to U-Net

## Goals
Our goal was to make a trainable pre processing pipeline for U-Net.

## Motivations
- Why we did what we did?
- What are we trying to achieve?

## Architecture
For this implementation we attempted to connect two different architectures together
- Explain how the 2 architectures connect

### Pre-Net
- Explain our Pre-Net
- Reference GenISP

### U-Net
 - Explain our U-Net

## Training Procedure
- How did we train it?
- What weights did we use?

## Results
- What results did we get?
- Why do we think it acts like that?
- How can they be interpreted?

## Next Step
- Future work
